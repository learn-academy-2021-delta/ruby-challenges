#As a developer, I can create a class called Task.

#As a developer, I can create three instances (objects) of class Task. 
#(e.g laundry = Task.new)
obj1 =Task.new
obj2 =Task.new
obj3 =Task.new
#As a developer, I can initialize each instance of class Task with a title.


# obj1.set_title 'apple',20,'orange'
# obj2.set_title 'elias',10,'peach'
# obj3.set_title 'Ross',20,'banna'
# puts obj1
# puts obj2
# puts obj3

# As a developer, I can see the title of each instance of class Task.
# As a developer, I can initialize each instance of class Task with a status that has a default value of 'incomplete'.
# As a developer, I can update the status of each instance of class Task when the task has been completed.
