# Challenge: Animal Kingdom
# Story: As a developer, I can make an Animal.



# Story: As a developer, upon initialization, I can give my Animal a status of alive, which will be set to true.

# Story: As a developer, I can give my Animal an age of 0 upon creation.

# Story: As a developer, I can age my Animal up one year at a time.

# Story: As a developer, I can return my Animal's age, as well as if they're alive. Hint: Use attr_accessor as well as an initialize method.

# Story: As a developer, I can create a Fish that inherits from Animal.

# Story: As a developer, I can initialize all of my fish to be cold_blooded (yes, there is one fish who is technically fully warm-blooded but we aren't going to talk about that).

# Story: As a developer, I can create a Salmon that inherits from Fish.

# Story: As a developer, I can initialize my Salmon to be a specific species (Atlantic, Sockeye, etc).

# Story: As a developer, I can see that my Salmon is cold-blooded.

class Animal
    attr_accessor :alive, :age
    def initialize
        @alive = true
        @age = 0
    end
    def set_age age
        @age = age
    end
end

# my_animal = Animal.new
# p my_animal.alive
# p my_animal.set_age(3)
# p my_animal.age

class Fish < Animal
    attr_reader :cold_blooded
    def initialize
        super
        @cold_blooded = true
    end
end
my_fish = Fish.new
p my_fish
# class Salmon < Fish
#     attr_accessor :species, :cold_blooded
#     def initialize(alive, age, cold_blooded, species)
#         super(cold_blooded)
#         @species = species
#     end
# end
# my_salmon = Salmon.new 'atlantic'
# p my_salmon
# Story: As a developer, I can age my Salmon up.

# Story: As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my Salmon's information.

# Story: As a developer, if my Salmon reaches the ripe old age of 4, I can make it die peacefully after a full and happy life. Hint: You will need a method that changes the status of alive in the initialize method of Animal.

# Story: As a developer, I can create a Mammal that inherits from Animal.

# Story: As a developer, I can initialize all of my Mammals to be warm_blooded.

# Story: As a developer, I can create a Bear that inherits from Mammal.

# Story: As a developer, I can age my Bear up.

# Story: As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my Bear's information.

# Story: As a developer, if my Bear turns 20 years old, I can make it die peacefully after a full and happy life. Hint: You will need a method that changes the status of alive in the initialize method of Animal.

# Story: As a developer, I can create a Mammal of my choice.

# Story: As a developer, I can interact with the new Mammal via various methods.

# Story: As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my new Mammal's information.

# Stretch Challenges
# Story: As a developer, I can keep a collection of two of each Animal. Hint: You'll want to add your Animals into an array.

# Story: As a developer, I can sort my collection of Animals based on age. Hint: Find out how the spaceship operator can help you with an array.

# Super Stretch Challenge
# Story: As a developer, I can utilize a Ruby module to help DRY up my code. I can create a swim method inside of my module that will apply to Animals who can swim. This method should return "I can swim!"
# Hint: Look into module mix ins. Since not all animals can swim, only certain Animals will have access to this module.
